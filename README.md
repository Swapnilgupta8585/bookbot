# BookBot
This Python script analyzes a text file by counting words and character frequencies.
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## What It Does

- **Counts Words**: Tells you how many words are in the file.
- **Counts Characters**: Shows how many times each character appears.
